# AutometricsTS ðŸ“ˆ

> A TypeScript port of the Rust
> [autometrics-rs](https://github.com/fiberplane/autometrics-rs) library

**A library that makes it easy to understand the error rate, response time, and
production usage of any function in your code.** Jump straight from your IDE to
live Prometheus charts for each HTTP/RPC handler, database method, or other
piece of application logic.


Autometrics for Typescript provides a wrapper function and a decorator that can
create OpenTelemetry metrics for your functions and class methods throughout
your code base, as well as a language service plugin that will write
corresponding Prometheus queries for you.

## Features

- âœ¨ `autometrics` wrapper instruments any function or class method to track the
  most useful metrics
- ðŸŒ³ Works in NodeJS server environments (Deno, serverless, and client support coming
  soon)    
- ðŸ’¡ Writes Prometheus queries so you can understand the data generated without
  knowing PromQL
- ðŸ”— Injects links to live Prometheus charts directly into each function's doc
  comments
- ðŸ“Š (Coming Soon!) Grafana dashboard showing the performance of all
  instrumented functions
- ðŸš¨ (Coming Soon!) Generates Prometheus alerting rules using SLO best practices
  from simple annotations in your code
- âš¡ Minimal runtime overhead

Currently Autometrics only works on the server with NodeJS. We're looking into
extending support for Deno, other runtimes, and the client.

## How it works

The AutometricsTS library consists of two parts:

- the wrapper and decorator helpers
- the language service plugin

#### The wrappers and decorators:

- Automatically instruments your code with OpenTelemetry metrics
- Uses a Prometheus Exporter to write metrics to a `/metrics` endpoint (by
  default on port `:9464`)

#### The language service plugin:
- Automatically writes useful Prometheus queries for instrumented functions and
  shows them in the doc comments.


## Getting started

### 1. Install and setup the library and the language service plugin

Install both the helpers and the language service plugin using these commands:

```shell
npm install --save @autometrics/autometrics
npm install --save-dev @autometrics/docs
```

Add the language service plugin to the `tsconfig.json` file:

```diff
{
    "compilerOptions": {
       ...
+        "plugins": [{
+            "name": "@autometrics/docs",
+            "prometheusUrl": ""
+        }]
    },
	...
}
```

#### Configuring language service plugin

|key |description |
|---|---|
| `name` | always `@autometrics/docs` |
| `prometheusUrl` | sets the base URL for PromQL queries. Default: `localhost:9090` |


> **Note:**
> 
> If on VSCode: make sure you select your VSCode Typescript server to local to
> the project (where you have Typescript installed in your `devDependencies`).
> 
> In `.vscode/settings.json` set:
> ```json
> {
>     "typescript.tsdk": "node_modules/typescript/lib"
> }
> ```

### 2. Wrap functions or decorate class methods

Use Autometrics wrappers to instrument the functions you want to track (e.g.:
request handlers or database calls).


#### Adding wrappers

Wrappers are simple functions that wrap the original function declaration
instrumenting it with metrics and allowing the language service plugin to add
additional information to the type docs.

Call the wrapped function to get metrics for the .

```diff
+ import { autometrics } from "autometrics";

function createHello() {
  return "hello"
}

+ // Now call the instrumented function as opposed to the original one
+ const hello = autometrics(createHello)
```

### Adding decorators

For methods where a decorator is added, they are wrapped in additional code that
instruments it with OpenTelemetry metrics.

Here's a snippet from the example code:

```diff
import { Controller, Get } from '@nestjs/common';
import { AppService } from './app.service';
+ import { autometricsDecorator as autometrics } from "autometrics";

@Controller()
export class AppController {
  constructor(private readonly appService: AppService) {}

  @Get()
+ @autometrics
  getHello(): string {
    return this.appService.getHello();
  }
}
```

### 3. Hover over the function name to see the generated queries

You can click on any of the links to go directly to the Prometheus chart for
that function.
